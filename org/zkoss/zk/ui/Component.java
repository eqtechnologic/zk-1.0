/**
 * An UI component.
 *
 * <p>There are two kind of life-cycles: one is page creations and the other
 * is asynchronous updates.
 *
 * <h3>The Page Creation</h3>
 * <p>The page creation occurs when a page is about to render at the first
 * time. The detailed phases can be found in the devloper's guide.
 *
 * <h3>The Asynchronous Update</h3>
 * <p>The asynchronous update occurs when users does something on the browser,
 * such as changing the content of input, clicking buttons and so on.
 * Such behaviors are packed as requests, queue in the browser, and then
 * send to the server at the proper time. The detailed phases
 * can be found in the developer's guide.
 *
 * <h3>No Synchronization Required</h3>
 * <p>To simplify the development of components and applications,
 * invocations of methods of components and event listener are all serialized.
 * In other words, application and component developers need not worry
 * synchronization and other thread issues (unless you are developing
 * background thread to handle long operations).
 *
 * <p>It also implies a limitation that you cannot access components
 * belonging to other desktops when processing an event.
