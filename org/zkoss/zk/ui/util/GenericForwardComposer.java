/**
 * <p>An abstract composer that you can extend and write intuitive onXxx$myid 
 * event handler methods with auto event forwarding and "auto-wired" accessible 
 * variable objects such as embedded objects, components, and external 
 * resolvable variables in a ZK zuml page; this class will add forward
 * condition to the myid source component and forward source onXxx 
 * event received by the source myid component to the target onXxx$myid event
 * (as defined in this composer) of the supervised target component; of course
 * it will also registers onXxx$myid events to the supervised 
 * component and wire all accessible variable objects to this composer by 
 * calling setXxx() method or set xxx field value directly per the variable 
 * name.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Notice that since this composer kept references to the components, single
 * instance object cannot be shared by multiple components.</p>
 *  
 * <p>The following is an example. The onChange event received by Textbox 
 * mytextbox will be forwarded to target Window mywin as a new target event 
 * onChange$mytextbox and the Textbox component with id name "mytextbox" and
 * Label with id name mylabel are injected into the "mytextbox" and "mylabel"
 * fields respectively(so you can use mytextbox and mylabel variable directly 
 * in onChange_mytextbox without problem).</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * MyComposer.java
 * 
 * public class MyComposer extends GenericForwardComposer {
 *     private Textbox mytextbox;
 *     private Window self; //embeded object, the supervised window "mywin"
 *     private Page page; //the ZK zuml page
 *     private Label mylabel;
 *     
 *     public void onChange$mytextbox(Event event) {
 *         mylabel.setValue("You just entered: "+ mytextbox.getValue());
 *     }
 * }
 * 
 * test.zul
 * 
 * &lt;window id="mywin" apply="MyComposer">
 *     &lt;textbox id="mytextbox"/>
 *     &lt;label id="mylabel"/>
 * &lt;/window>
 * </code></pre>
