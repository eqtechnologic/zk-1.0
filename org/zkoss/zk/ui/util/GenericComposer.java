/**
 * <p>An abstract composer that you can extend and write intuitive onXxx event handler methods;
 * this class will registers onXxx events to the supervised component automatically.</p>
 * <p>The following is an example. The onOK and onCancel event listener is registered into 
 * the target main window automatically.</p>
 * 
 * <pre><code>
 * &lt;zscript>&lt;!-- both OK in zscript or a compiled Java class -->
 * public class MyComposer extends GenericComposer {
 *    public void onOK() {
 *        //doOK!
 *        //...
 *    }
 *    public void onCancel() {
 *        //doCancel
 *        //...
 *    } 
 * }
 * &lt;/zscript>
 *
 * &lt;window id="main" apply="MyComposer">
 *     ...
 * &lt;/window>
 * </code></pre>
 * <p>since 3.6.1, this composer would be assigned as a variable of the given component 
 * per the naming convention composed of the component id and composer Class name. e.g.
 * If the applied component id is "xwin" and this composer class is 
 * org.zkoss.MyComposer, then the variable name would be "xwin$MyComposer". You can
 * reference this composer with {@link Component#getAttributeOrFellow} or via EL as ${xwin$MyComposer}
 * of via annotate data binder as @{xwin$MyComposer}, etc. If this composer is the 
 * first composer applied to the component, a shorter variable name
 * composed of the component id and a String "composer" would be also available for use. 
 * Per the above example, you can also reference this composer with the name "xwin$composer"</p>
 *
 * <p>Notice that, since 3.6.2, this composer becomes serializable.
