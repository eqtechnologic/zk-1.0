/**
 * Implemented by an initiator that will be invoked if it is specified
 * in the init directive.
 *
 * <p>&lt;?init class="MyInit"?&gt;
 *
 * <p>Once specified, an instance is created and {@link #doInit} is called
 * before the page is evaluated. Then, {@link #doAfterCompose} is called
 * after all components are created, and before any event is processed.
 * In additions, {@link #doFinally} is called
 * after the page has been evaluated. If an exception occurs, {@link #doCatch}
 * is called.
 *
 * <p>A typical usage: starting a transaction in doInit, rolling back it
 * in {@link #doCatch} and commit it in {@link #doFinally}
 * (if {@link #doCatch} is not called).

	 * this method (to override the declarations in the page definition)
	 * by {@link org.zkoss.zk.ui.Page#setId}, {@link Page#setTitle} and {@link Page#setStyle}.
	 * In additions, {@link Page#getRequestPath}
	 * and {@link Page#getAttribute} are all available.

	 * @param page the page being evaluated
	 * @param args a map of arguments.
	 * Prior to 3.6.2, it is an array. To upgrade, use args.get("arg0")
	 * instead of args[0], args.get("arg1") instead of args[1] and so on.
	 * Of course, it is better to have a more meaningful name for
	 * each argument.
	 * If no argument is specified, args is an empty map (never null).
